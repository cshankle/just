# 20 Years of More SMCM Data than You Could Possibly Want
### Name

## Introduction

Through my data exploration, I really wanted to look at change at St. Mary's throughout the 20 year period. I've gotten to know SMCM in a very strange time period - to understate it. By examining this data, I hoped to start to see the general arc of culture at St. Mary's. Although I didn't go to in depth to this for my data exploration, one interesting aspect of the data was the student life section. In this section, it listed major involvements that college campuses might offer and whether we had them. Seeing how these changed throughout the 20 year period was very interesting. 

My other interest in this data came from my work with the Admission Office. In the office, we think a lot about who we are attracting to the college, growing our student body, and retaining students. By exploring demographics, retention, and cost throughout the 20 year period of time, we can find patterns and see where it is better to focus time and energy.

## Dataset

I found this data on the SMCM page for institutional research under the tab Common Data Set. The college collects data about student body and faculty every year then releases it to the public on the institutional research part of the school website. They have been collecting this data since 2002, so it offers up a pretty nice picture of modern SMCM history. In its original form, the data is formatted as a pdf with all of the information for that school year. Because of this, I had to transcribe all of the data into an excel spreadsheet in order to work with it.
